The antidote for imposter syndrome is doing something. Who cares what people
think? What matters is living. And life doesn’t happen in a straight line,
according to Alie Ward, who is making a study of the people who are learning all
sorts of things in the process of living. Her advice: embrace your mutations.
According to evolutionary biology, it is our mutations that give us an edge in
our ability to adapt to our environment.

What are my mutations? I have a terrible memory. That is why I write. I don’t
know much about anything. That is why I observe, listen, and read. I am a
terrible communicator. That is why I study design and communications. I am a
terrible artist. That is why I study art, design, and architecture. I keep
wondering why the Bauhaus no longer exists. So, I keep discovering the many ways
that the Bauhaus has and continues to shape and transform our world. It is also
the reason I am curious about the world of ideas and how good ideas spread.

So, if that is what makes me weird, I am okay with that. I am embracing my
mutations.
