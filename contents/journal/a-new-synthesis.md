In the service of industrial models of social and political engineering, art and
technology have been co-opted to participate in a military-industrial complex
that is a synthesis of our worst human characteristics: greed and hatred.

We are caught in a dialectic of opposing forces, in the politics of thesis and
antithesis, right versus left. We need a new synthesis that transcends the old
paradigms. Unity in diversity is the model for both the organism and the planet.

**The new synthesis is integrating biology and physics.** The future of design
and architecture may be in the integration of the separate disciplines to learn
how interconnected systems work and model the built environment to imitate the
processes of living organisms. We are beginning to see these changes happening
through the self-organizing principles of biological adaptation.
